<!-- <p>About Service Year</p> -->
<h1>Service Year in Jos, Plateau State</h1>
<p> Plateau State is the coldest state in Nigeria. There are 17 local governments with over 100 ethnic tribes and above
 200 indigenious languages; Hausa is just one of these languages.

<p>On my arrival at Mangu, I was warmly welcomed <em>sannu de zuwa</em> in this cold state also known as the hub perhaps
 home of tourism in Nigeria. Indeed, tourist centers in Jos North and South alone (two out of 17 local governments) like
 colourful flowers will attract your bees-but for the inter-tribal and boundary disputes serving as smokes that scares
 off the bees. </p>
<p>Jos, where I lived for a year has it... <em>(to be continued). </em></p>
